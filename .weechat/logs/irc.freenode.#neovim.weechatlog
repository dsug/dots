2017-11-18 16:04:24	dsugo	Hello! I have in my init file these commands: set foldenable, set foldmethod=syntax, set foldlevel=99 but folding still doesn't work
2017-11-18 16:04:29	dsugo	am i missing smth?
2017-11-18 16:05:15	dsugo	btw. folding is working when i type set foldmethod while nvim is running
2017-11-18 16:05:37	dsugo	i mean set foldmethod=syntax
2017-11-18 16:05:38	dsugo	*
2017-11-18 16:12:41	pepper_chico	dsugo: what's the fold method before you set it by command?
2017-11-18 16:13:07	pepper_chico	you can check by :set foldmethod?
2017-11-18 16:13:18	dsugo	pepper_chico: roger, gimme sec
2017-11-18 16:14:02	dsugo	pepper_chico: it says: foldmethod=syntax
2017-11-18 16:14:03	pepper_chico	dsugo: you should put the ? at the final
2017-11-18 16:14:27	pepper_chico	hmm, ok, I thought it got changed by a plugin or something....
2017-11-18 16:16:17	pepper_chico	dsugo: this kind of problem is the same as you could get for vim, almost 99% of chance. So you may find more help in the #vim channel. It's more active there for this kind of troubleshooting.
2017-11-18 16:16:41	dsugo	pepper_chico: ok, I will try 
2017-11-18 16:16:48	dsugo	pepper_chico: thanks for help :D
2017-11-18 16:16:54	pepper_chico	😉
2017-11-18 16:18:08	pepper_chico	dsugo: unless you have it working in vim already, just not neovim
2017-11-18 16:18:19	pepper_chico	then you're better here 😛
2017-11-18 16:23:49	dsugo	pepper_chico: i don't use vim :/
2017-11-18 16:24:02	dsugo	im fairly new into vim/programming etc
2017-11-18 16:24:10	dsugo	so i straightfully go into neovim
2017-11-18 16:25:08	pepper_chico	ok, sadly I can't give much help because I always use foldmethod=marker
2017-11-18 16:25:23	pepper_chico	and it simply works
2017-11-18 16:25:30	dsugo	hm
2017-11-18 16:25:59	pepper_chico	it's another kind of fold, you may not be interested in
2017-11-18 16:26:55	dsugo	pepper_chico: you have to mark all the text that you want to fold?
2017-11-18 16:26:58	dsugo	i mean mark manually
2017-11-18 16:28:23	pepper_chico	dsugo: yes, I only like fold where I want things hidden.
2017-11-18 16:28:51	dsugo	soo I can type zf10j
2017-11-18 16:29:00	dsugo	and it will fold 10 lines down
2017-11-18 16:29:40	dsugo	and it's temporary or these fold are actually saved for later?
2017-11-18 16:30:51	pepper_chico	maybe they are saved if you make you of sessions, and load the session later. They sure are not saved in the file.
2017-11-18 16:31:00	pepper_chico	sole marker based ones are
2017-11-18 16:31:06	pepper_chico	solely*

I can benchmark the code itself somewhat easily of course, but in this case I'd also like to include the cost of communication in the benchmark, but not the cost of loading the file from the file system.

2017-11-18 21:53:21	gitter_killthemu	Well, dotfiles should be easy, put loading the colorscheme into your `init.vim` (see `:h colorscheme`), and put the colorscheme files into the right directory, probably only one file into `runtime/colors`, and you can find where `runtime` by running `:echo $VIMRUNTIME`
